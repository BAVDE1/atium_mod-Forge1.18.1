Welcome to the Atium Mod github!

## > What is it?

The Atium Mod is a Minecraft mod for Forge 1.18.1 that is currently is development.
It aims to bring a couple new kinds of ore into play with various powers and abilities to each.

So far all that is planned is to be added is Atium ore and Malatium ore (name might change). 
Atium will generate in the Overworld (hopefully in big atium geodes).
And Malatium will spawn in the Nether (possibly with a guardian of some type).

There will be more things to the mod as well, and possibly a 3rd ore in the End. 

### > More features!

Adding the real mistborn powers into the mod (the burning of metals for powers) i feel will be an incredibly difficult task. 
So I was thinking that instead of burning metals, i can use atium, malatium, and electrum to sort of conduct the metals and use their various powers. I might have the metals imbued or infused upon the atium/malatium/electrum gear to access the powers.
